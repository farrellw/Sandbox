<p>A <b>volcano</b> is a mountain where lava (hot, liquid rock) comes from a magma chamber under the ground.[1]</p>

<p>Most volcanoes have a volcanic crater at the top. When a volcano is active, materials come out of it. The materials include lava, steam, gaseous sulfur compounds, ash and broken rock pieces.</p>

<p>When there is enough pressure, the volcano erupts. Some volcanic eruptions blow off the top of the volcano. The magma comes out, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly. Some eruptions come out at a side instead of the top.</p>

<p>Volcanoes are found on planets other than Earth. An example is Olympus Mons on Mars.</p>

<p>Volcanologists are scientists who study volcanoes using methods from geology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, physics and sociology.</p>
