<p><b>Jupiter</b> is the largest planet in the Solar System.[10] It is the fifth planet from the Sun.[11] Jupiter is classified as a gas giant, both because it is so large and due to the fact that it is made up mostly of gas. The other gas giants are Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>

<p>Jupiter has a mass of 1.8986Ã—1027 kg, or about 318 Earths.[2] This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together.[12]</p>

<p>Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye. It was known to the ancient Romans, who named it after their god Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter).[13][14] Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky. Only the Earth's moon and Venus are brighter.[15][16]</p>

<p>Jupiter has at least 67 moons. Of these, 55 are very small and less than five kilometres wide. The four largest moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are collectively called the Galilean moons, because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. It is larger in diameter even than Mercury.</p>
