<p><b>Turtles</b> are the reptile order Testudines. They have a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield.</p>

<p>The order Testudines includes both living and extinct species. The earliest fossil turtles date from about 220 million years ago. So turtles are one of the oldest surviving reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards, snakes and crocodiles.</p>

<p>Turtle have been very successful, and have an almost world-wide distribution. But, of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered.</p>
