<p><b>Zeus</b> (Latin: Jupiter or Jove; Ancient Greek: Ζεύς) is the King of Gods, ruler of Mount Olympus in Greek mythology, and one of the Twelve Olympians.</p>

<p>Zeus is the sixth child of Kronus, ruler of the Titans, and Rhea. His father, Cronus swallowed every child he had with Rhea because he feared the prophecy that his children will overthrow him as ruler of Mount Olympus. When Zeus was born, Rhea gave a stone instead of Zeus for Cronus to swallow. Rhea then hid Zeus in safety.Zeus grew up in a cave in Crete then he overthrew Cronus with his allies, the Cyclopes. The battle was known as Titanomachy. Because they could they were immortal or could not die. Zeus imprisoned Cronus in Tartarus. He then became the King of Gods, predicted by the prophecy that Cronus once feared.</p>

<p>He was praised all throughout Ancient Greece. He was regarded with utmost respect. He was the most important god of all the twelve Olympians. Zeus controlled the weather and can order any god or mortal, except the Fates.</p>

<p>He married his sister Hera, but had many affairs and children with many other women, both goddesses and mortals. This irritated Hera greatly, who couldn't have affairs at all, due to her being the Goddess of Marriage.</p>

<p>His brothers were Poseidon and Hades. He agreed to split the world with them, and Zeus got the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the Underworld. [2][3] The ancient Olympic Games were held in his honor. Zeus' sisters were Hera, Demeter, and Hestia. They all had thrones in Olympus but for her own reasons, Hestia gave up hers to Dionysus, God of Wine.</p>
